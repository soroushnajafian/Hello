# Hello
My first github pages
```
import numpy as np
```
```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```
```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

I think you should use an
`<numpy>` element here instead.
